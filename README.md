**PDF Invoice Data Extractor**
This is a full-stack web application designed to streamline invoice processing. Users can upload a PDF invoice, view it in the browser, and use the Google Gemini AI to automatically extract key information. The extracted data is then populated into an editable form, allowing for corrections before being saved to a MongoDB database. The application features full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for managing the saved invoices.

-Backend: Node.js, Express, TypeScript

-Database: MongoDB Atlas

-AI Service: Google Gemini API

-Deployment: Vercel

**Getting Started: Local Development**
Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

-Prerequisites
Node.js (v20.x LTS recommended)
pnpm (install with npm install -g pnpm)
A MongoDB database (local or a free cloud instance from MongoDB Atlas)
A Google Gemini API Key

-1. Setup
First, clone the repository and install the dependencies.
Bash

# Clone the repository
git clone [ADD YOUR GITHUB REPO URL HERE]

# Navigate into the project directory
cd pdf-invoice-extractor

# Install all dependencies for the entire monorepo
pnpm install

-2. Environment Variables
The backend API requires a .env file with your database connection string and AI API key.
Navigate to the API directory: cd apps/api
Create a new file named .env
Copy the content from the example below and paste it into your .env file, replacing the placeholder values with your actual credentials.

3. How to Run Locally
You can run both the frontend and backend servers concurrently with a single command from the root of the project.

Bash

pnpm dev
The frontend Next.js app will be available at http://localhost:3000.

The backend Express API will be available at http://localhost:8000.

The frontend is configured with a proxy, so any API calls it makes to /api/... will be automatically forwarded to the backend on port 8000.
